This App uses the Automatic REST API to collect data.  You will need to sign up for access to the API here:

	https://developer.automatic.com/dashboard/

Access is not granted immediately, so be patient.  Return to the same website to obtain your "Client Id" and "Client Secret".

Then open the "Formatted Authorize URL" in a web browser and authorize your App.

Once you have a key, you can fill out the connectivity information in the Modular Input.

After you are collecting data, all of the dashboards should work for you and you can start investingating right away!
